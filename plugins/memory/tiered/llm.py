"""Shared LLM helper for tiered memory composition.

Composer: moonshotai/kimi-k2.6 via OpenRouter.

P169/MOL-560: dropped the local Ollama qwen3:1.7b primary path entirely.
Post-MOL-546 the embedder is in-process via fastembed, so the composer
was the only remaining Ollama consumer. Removing it lets us stop the
Ollama daemon permanently and reclaim ~220 MB resident + remove a
launchd-managed background process from the stack.

Quality direction is UP (Kimi K2.6 ≫ qwen3:1.7b on instruction following
and long-form summarization). Cost trade is ~$0.01-0.05 per nightly
consolidation run — accepted as worth the operational simplification.

Public API `llm_compose(prompt, context)` signature is unchanged.

P169 review fix-pass (silent-failure-hunter findings on PR #200):
- Distinct `ComposerKeyMissing` / `ComposerAuthFailure` exceptions separate
  permanent-failure modes (missing key, expired key) from transient ones
  (rate limit, 5xx, network blip). Both write tripwires to
  `~/.hermes/state/composer-<reason>-<ts>.json` so cron failures surface
  via the existing maintenance-pending scanner instead of waiting for
  MEMORY.md staleness to become user-visible.
- `COMPOSER_BASE_URL` resolved-value logged once per process so a stale
  `HERMES_MOCK_LLM_URL` env var doesn't silently redirect production to
  the mock (`Mock-First Dev Loops` memory pattern).
- Per-process `MAX_COMPOSER_CALLS_PER_RUN` budget cap guards against
  runaway loops in multi-session ingest paths (memory_ingest_external.py
  calls llm_compose once per session × N sessions × cron tick).
